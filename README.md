# 🧰 QueueCTL — Background Job Queue System

## 📘 Overview  
**QueueCTL** is a Python-based CLI background job system that manages and executes queued tasks using worker processes.  
It supports **automatic retries**, **exponential backoff**, and a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for permanently failed jobs —  
all with **persistent storage** powered by SQLite.

This project was developed as part of a **Backend Developer Internship Assignment**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Enqueue and manage background jobs via CLI  
- ✅ Multiple worker process support (`--count`)  
- ✅ Retry mechanism with exponential backoff  
- ✅ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed jobs  
- ✅ Persistent SQLite database  
- ✅ Simple and modular Python codebase  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **CLI Framework:** Click  
- **Operating System:** Windows / macOS / Linux

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### ✅ Step 1 — Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavanBoggavarapu/queuectl.git
cd queuectl

###Step 2 — Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

###Enqueue Jobs
python queuectl.py enqueue "{\"id\":\"job1\",\"command\":\"echo hello\"}"
python queuectl.py enqueue "{\"id\":\"job2\",\"command\":\"echo success\"}"
python queuectl.py enqueue "{\"id\":\"job3\",\"command\":\"wrongcmd\"}"

###List All Jobs

python queuectl.py list

###Start Worker
python queuectl.py worker --count 1

###View Dead Letter Queue
python queuectl.py dlq

| State        | Meaning                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `pending`    | Job waiting for execution          |
| `processing` | Job is running                     |
| `completed`  | Job executed successfully          |
| `failed`     | Job failed and will retry          |
| `dead`       | Job moved to DLQ after max retries |

###Retry & Backoff Logic

QueueCTL uses exponential backoff for retries:

delay = base ^ attempts

###Example (base = 2):
✅ 1st retry → 2 seconds
✅ 2nd retry → 4 seconds
✅ 3rd retry → 8 seconds

###After exceeding max_retries, the job is moved to the Dead Letter Queue.

###Example Run
python queuectl.py enqueue "{\"id\":\"demo1\",\"command\":\"echo demo\"}"
python queuectl.py list
python queuectl.py worker --count 1
python queuectl.py dlq

###Expected Output
✅ Job 'demo1' added successfully.
[Worker 1] ▶️ Running job demo1 (attempt 1)
[Worker 1] ✅ Completed job demo1
